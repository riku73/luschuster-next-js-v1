# 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules (Example Configuration)

## How to Set Up Branch Protection on GitHub

### 1. Go to Repository Settings
- Navigate to your repo on GitHub
- Click "Settings" tab
- Click "Branches" in left sidebar

### 2. Add Rule for Main Branch
Click "Add rule" and configure:

#### Basic Settings
- **Branch name pattern**: `main`
- **Restrict pushes that create matching branches**: ✅

#### Pull Request Requirements
- **Require a pull request before merging**: ✅
  - **Require approvals**: 1 (for teams)
  - **Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed**: ✅
  - **Require review from code owners**: ✅ (if you have CODEOWNERS file)

#### Status Check Requirements
- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: ✅
  - **Require branches to be up to date before merging**: ✅
  - **Status checks**: Select your GitHub Actions workflows
    - ✅ quality-check
    - ✅ security
    - ✅ build

#### Additional Restrictions
- **Restrict pushes that create matching branches**: ✅
- **Allow force pushes**: ❌ (Never on main!)
- **Allow deletions**: ❌

## 👥 Example CODEOWNERS File
Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# Global owners - these people review everything
* @your-username

# Frontend specific
*.tsx @frontend-team
*.css @design-team

# Backend specific
/api/ @backend-team

# Documentation
*.md @docs-team

# Configuration files
docker-compose*.yml @devops-team
.github/ @devops-team

# Critical files need extra review
package.json @senior-developers
Dockerfile @devops-team @senior-developers
```

## 🔄 Professional Workflow Example

### Developer Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/contact-form-validation

# 2. Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add email validation to contact form"
git commit -m "Add phone number formatting"
git commit -m "Add form submission feedback"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/contact-form-validation
# GitHub will show "Compare & pull request" button

# 4. Fill out PR template
# 5. Wait for reviews and CI checks
# 6. Address feedback if needed
# 7. Merge when approved
```

### Team Lead Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Review PR on GitHub
# 2. Check CI status
# 3. Test staging deployment
# 4. Approve or request changes
# 5. Merge to main
# 6. Monitor production deployment
```
